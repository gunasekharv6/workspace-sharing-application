                                    We are four college students who were simply trying to create collaborative workspaces provding all the required amenities to the clients especially smaller firms like startup's. We want to create a business where quality was never sacrificed for convenience. On 10 April 2021, we have launched this website in Boston and then spreaded over our wings to various places.

                                    In a world where infrastructural is not being considered to be that important factor as work can either be get done by employees working hybrid or remote, we are willing to provide you those flexible spaces that suit you for your requirement of that particular period. Both individuals and team can book spaces and work in the atmost comfortable and peaceful environment. Our hope is to atleast provide good and affordable spaces for start up companies where budget is a strssful factor in the early stages. Even team meeting of an Fortune 500 company can also be held in our spaces as it is readily available and is sophisticated as well.
